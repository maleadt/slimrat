Copy-on-write
=============

Care has been taken to improve slimrat's performance, which has led to the
  choice of using fork() instead of ithreads. Linux -- the main target for
  slimrat -- implements the fork() system-call quite efficiently, improving
  its performance by using copy-on-write paging.

In order to savour this advantage, fork()'d threads should minimize any writes
  to the memory, this contrary how slimrat 1.x worked. Inter-process
  communication should be accomplished through the XML-RPC interface (if this
  turns out to be too slow, the server might get extended with SYSV IPC or
  Unix sockets), and more persistent data should always end up in the database.
